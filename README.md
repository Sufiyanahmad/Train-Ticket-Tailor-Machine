### Notes
- **Filename Adjustments**: Renamed files to match class names (e.g., `TrafficLightController.java`). Adjust if you prefer original names.
- **License**: Used MIT License. For alternatives, visit [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
- **Common Issues**:
  - Authentication: Use a personal access token (GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic), `repo` scope).
  - Push errors: Resolve with `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`.
  - Java: Ensure JDK 8 or later is installed.
- **Discoverability**: Public repositories with descriptive `README.md`, and `LICENSE`, and files are indexed by Google over time.
- **Error Handling**: The Java programs could benefit from better input validation (e.g., handling non-integer inputs). I can enhance if requested.
